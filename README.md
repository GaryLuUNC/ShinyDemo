# ShinyDemo

This interactive visualization allows you to choose a year on the slider and the bar plot will show how many medals each country won in that year.

To run the visualization:

1. Open up RStudio.
2. Run the line of code getwd(); to see which folder does R look for files. 
3. Download Shiny.R and Summer-Olympic-medals-1976-to-2008.csv from this repository and save it to said folder.
4. Open up Shiny.R in RStudio and run the script.

Note: It is recommended that you view this visualization in full screen.
